# main.h

This header file contains the function declarations for the following functions:

- `binary_to_uint`
- `print_binary`
- `get_bit`
- `set_bit`
- `flip_bits`
- `_putchar`
- `clear_bit`

## Function Descriptions

### `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b)`

Converts a binary string to an unsigned integer.

### `void print_binary(unsigned long int n)`

Prints the binary representation of an unsigned long integer to the console.

### `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)`

Gets the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long integer.

### `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

Sets the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long integer.

### `unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m)`

Flips the bits in one unsigned long integer based on the corresponding bits in another unsigned long integer.

### `int _putchar(char c)`

Writes a character to the standard output.

### `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index)`

Clears the value of a bit at a given index in an unsigned long integer.

## Usage
